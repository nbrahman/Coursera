1. Justification and Background
========================================================
The shiny application developed explains the Effect of Lambda, No. of Observations and No. of Exponentials in Exponential Distribution and Central Limit Theorem Simulation

There are 3 slider controls to change either of the parameters. Based on the changes in slider controls, the graphs are updated automatically. Although, refreshing the graphs takes some time due to the random number generation and the computations involved internally.

The reason to develop this particular app using shiny because of the following reasons
- The power of interacive charts and apps resides in the capacity to engage users to act upon controls and see immediate responses in parameters inputs and changes.

- Analytics, data science and statitical analysis benefit significantly from the new power unleashed by open source code and the internet.

2. Exponential Distribution - Scatter Plot and histogram
========================================================
The scater plot containing exponential distribution with certain lambda and number of observations plots the random numbers generated while performing the experiments. Similarly, the histogram "Exponential Distribution's mean distribution" graph displays the distribution of the mean of the random numbers generated.
